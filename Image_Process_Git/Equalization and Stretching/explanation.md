Today is my first uploading in GitHub.
I'm so excited to start my activity. You'll see my progress!

I learned about Equalization and Histogram Stretching.
I think we need to know why they use these methods.

Before we know about them we need to know about "image contrast".
It's simply says that the difference between bright region and dark region.

If we look at these 4 images. All left box have the same intensity but it seems a little difference because of the right box.
The same color can appear differntly depending on the brightness of adjacent colors, which can cause confusion in images where contrast is low.

If an image contains mostly similar pixel values, it becomes difficult to identify important features or details.
Among the ways to improve image quality, we will try to improve image contrast.
