Today is my first uploading in GitHub.
I'm so excited to start my activity. You'll see my progress!

I learned about Equalization and Histogram Stretching.
I think we need to know why they use these methods.

Before we know about them we need to know about "image contrast".
It's simply says that the difference between bright region and dark region.
